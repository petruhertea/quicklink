<h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign up, we collect information provided by your identity provider (GitHub, Google, or Microsoft). This may include your name, email address, profile picture, and a unique provider-assigned identifier. We do not receive or store your password for those third-party services.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect certain data about how you interact with the Service, including the URLs you submit, the short codes generated, click and redirect counts, and general analytics associated with your links.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We may collect your IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, and referring URLs for the purposes of security monitoring and service improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Payment processing for Premium subscriptions is handled entirely by Stripe. We do not store, process, or have access to your credit card numbers or other payment details. We retain only the Stripe customer ID and subscription status necessary to manage your account.</p>

<h3>3. Cookies and Tracking</h3>

<p><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use session cookies to maintain your logged-in state during a browser session. These cookies are deleted when your browser session ends.</p>

<p><strong>OAuth Cookies:</strong> During the OAuth authentication flow with GitHub, Google, or Microsoft, temporary cookies are used to maintain state. These are consumed upon completion of the login process.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Cookies (Google AdSense):</strong> On pages displaying ads (free tier only), third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.</p>

</p>

<h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
<p>
    We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. Upon account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your data unless retention is required by law.
